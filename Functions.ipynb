        "Question 2:\n",
        "Story: Bob is a bank customer who wants to manage his bank account. He wants to create a class to represent his account.\n",
        "Question: Define a class called \"BankAccount\" that has instance variables for account number and balance. Create methods called \"deposit\" and \"withdraw\" to update the account balance accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 3:\n",
        "Story: Carol loves animals and wants to create a class hierarchy to represent different types of animals.\n",
        "Question: Define a base class called \"Animal\" that has a method called \"sound\" which prints a generic sound. Create two derived classes called \"Dog\" and \"Cat\" that override the \"sound\" method to print \"Woof\" and \"Meow\" respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 4:\n",
        "Story: David is a game developer who wants to create a class for a player in a game.\n",
        "Question: Define a class called \"Player\" that has instance variables for player name and score. Implement a method called \"update_score\" that takes a parameter and updates the player's score by adding the provided value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 5:\n",
        "Story: Emily wants to create a class to represent a rectangle shape.\n",
        "Question: Define a class called \"Rectangle\" that has instance variables for length and width. Implement a method called \"calculate_area\" that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.\n",
        "\n",
        "These questions cover basic concepts like class definition, constructor, instance variables, methods, inheritance, and method implementation. They should provide a good foundation for understanding object-oriented programming in Python."
